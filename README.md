# task-fragmentation
This repository showcases the process of breaking down the user interface (UI) into selective components to enhance code modularity, reusability, and organization. Below are the steps taken to accomplish this task:

Task Overview
Identifying UI Sections
Analysis: Conducted an in-depth analysis of the existing UI to identify distinct sections or standalone elements.
Examples: Recognized various UI sections including navigation bars, forms, lists, cards, and other isolated segments.
Creating Components
Componentization: Divided each identified UI section into separate components.
Reusable Units: Ensured each component encapsulated a specific part of the UI and could be reused across the application.
Reorganizing the Code
Refactoring: Restructured the existing codebase to incorporate the newly created UI components seamlessly.
Integration: Replaced relevant sections in the code with the new components to improve overall code readability.

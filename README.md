## Overview

This repository demonstrates the fragmentation of a user interface (UI) into selective components for an improved development structure. The decision to break down the UI into distinct components was based on several factors:

## Justification

### Modular Development

Fragmenting the UI into components enhances modularity, making it easier to manage and maintain the codebase. Each component serves a specific purpose, ensuring clear separation of concerns and ease of development.

### Reusability and Scalability

By creating reusable components, the application gains flexibility and scalability. Components like `AppToast`, `BurnButtonBar`, and `ChainSelector` can be reused across multiple sections, promoting code reusability and reducing redundancy.

### Improved Readability and Maintainability

Breaking the UI into smaller, focused components significantly enhances code readability. Developers can easily understand, modify, and maintain specific parts of the application without affecting unrelated sections.

### Streamlined Collaboration

Fragmentation facilitates collaboration among team members. Clear and isolated components enable parallel development and easier integration of new features or updates.

## Choice of Components

Each component was chosen based on its standalone functionality and reusability:

- `AppToast`
- `BurnButtonBar`
- `BurnStatsContainer`
- `BurnTxTable`
- `ChainSelector`
- `TransactionTableStyled`

## Implementation

The implementation involved identifying distinct UI sections and converting them into reusable components. The code was refactored to integrate these components seamlessly, ensuring smooth functionality and improved code organization.

## Conclusion

The fragmentation into selective components offers enhanced development efficiency, code maintainability, and scalability. This approach fosters a cleaner, more organized codebase, enabling easier collaboration and future enhancements.
